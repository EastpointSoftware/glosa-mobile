These are notes describing how to create and use the test files. These files allow the following:

1. Cache locally all MAP data for all testable juntions and pedestrian crossings. see MAP-XXXX.xml
2. Cached route of junctions and pedestrian crossings. You can add/remove as needed. see GLOSA-MAP-CHACHE.kml
3. Simulated GPS points for a particular juntion or pedestrian crossing. see XXXX-IB.kml (inbound journey) or XXXX.OB.kml (outbound journey).
These files essentially have 3-4 GPS points that track a vehicle heading towards a juntion or predestrian crossing. 

In the example below the first point is the furthest from the juntion or pedestrian crossing and the last point is the closest. When testing a particular
juntion you can tell the app which way you are heading by picking an inbound or outbound journey. The app then reads in the points and caluates an average heading.
